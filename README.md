# AI-MONKEYBANANA
First let’s see what the Monkey Banana Problem is…

Imagine a monkey in a room, eyeing a bunch of bananas hanging from the middle of the ceiling. The monkey wants to get those bananas, but it needs to figure out the exact sequence of moves to reach them efficiently. Shall we help the monkey to grasp the bananas?
Background of the Problem
There is a monkey in a room with a bunch of bananas hanging from the middle of the ceiling. The room contains a box. The monkey’s task is to figure out how to use the box to reach the bananas.

However, the monkey is allowed to perform specific actions to get the bananas.

Monkeys can walk on the floor
Monkey can push the box
Monkey can climb on the box
Monkey can grasp the bananas
But the monkey cannot jump or do any other action. For example, if the monkey is on the box which is at the door, a monkey cannot get the banana since it is not allowed to jump.
To grasp the bananas:
The monkey must push the box to the middle of the room.
Then, the monkey must climb onto the box.
While standing on the box, the monkey can grasp the bananas.
The challenge is to determine the correct sequence of actions that will enable the monkey to achieve the goal.
